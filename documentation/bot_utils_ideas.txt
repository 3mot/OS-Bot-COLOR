BOTUTILS


Possible properties:
- a map of the position of each inventory slot
- the NPC tag colour and object marker colour
- ground items colour
- coordinates of HP, Prayer, Spec, Inventory, Prayerbook, Spellbook,
- coordinates of gameplay view
- maybe the position of the XP counter that will be used to determine if taking action


Possible functions:
- setup_window() --> focuses and moves RL client, sets camera
	- reset_plugins() --> goes to each major plugin and resets them.
	- set_fixed_layout() --> uses OpenCV to go to settings and set layout to classic.
- enable_entity_hider() --> MAYBE?
- drop_from_inventory(image) --> given an image, shift click all matches in inventory space
- a function to find an image on screen might involve taking a screenshot, storing it in a
  temporary path, opening the screenshot and using OpenCV to find the image within the image.
- image_to_text() --> this can be used to get the number representation of HP, prayer, etc.
  Requires Tesseract-OCR.
	- get_hp()
	- get_prayer()
	- get_special()
- click_nearest_tag() --> will determine where the nearest tagged area is and click
- click_nearest_marker() --> same as above but for objects
- loot_highlighted_items() --> picks up all visible highlighted ground items


Concerns:
- If I take a bunch of screenshots on my PC, will those images be recognized on another?
- How do I know if the player is idle?


RL Plugins:
- Object Markers for skilling
- NPC Indicators for combat
- Ground Items
- Entity Hider (maybe)
